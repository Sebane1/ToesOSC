Proof of concept for toe control via OSC.
Commands can be sent by holding or releasing Q,W,E,R for the left toes, and A,S,D,F for the right toes.
Or, click the buttons on the user interface.

Avatars toes will need to be built to respond to boolean OSC input.

May need some engineering help to build some custom hardware to track real life toe movement.
